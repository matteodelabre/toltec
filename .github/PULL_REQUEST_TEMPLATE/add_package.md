<!--
  - Hi! Thanks for adding a new package to toltec and helping the community
  - to grow and enjoy more software on their devices!
  -
  - First off, you may want to change the branch from `stable` to `testing`
  - above to get rid of the pesky cross (❌).
  - 
  - A good starting point would be give a rough description of:
  -  * What the package does
  -  * Whether you're the author of it
  -  * If the package was developed/tested for a specific model
  - 
  - A member will reply to you shortly to get the package ready for testing.
  - As soon as the package file looks good and it was sucessfully tested on
  - both devices, we can add it! 🎊🎉🎊
  -
  - Please also look out for what the CI shows you. It'll point out any issues
  - in the styling or formatting of your file and try to build the package.
  - You can test these check by running these commands if you don't want the
  - CI to check it each commit (since it may take a bit):
  -  * make <packagename>
  -  * make format
  -  * make lint
  - 
  - If you're not sure though just go ahead and create the PR anyway,
  - we can help you along the way even if you don't really know how
  - to package it yet. 😉
