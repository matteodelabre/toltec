## Contributing to Toltec

Thank you for taking time to contribute to Toltec!
We welcome contributions from anyone, regarding for example [reporting bugs](#reporting-a-bug), [requesting](#request-a-package) or [adding new packages](#adding-a-new-package), [upgrading existing ones](#upgrading-a-package), [improving the docs](#improving-the-documentation), or other topics.

To make a request or report a bug, you simply need to [open a new issue](../../../issues/new/choose).

To directly propose changes, the basic procedure is to fork this repository, make the desired changes in your newly created local copy, and open a pull request.
**When creating your pull request, make sure to target the `testing` branch instead of the default `stable` branch** (PRs against the `stable` branch will not be merged).

When proposing changes, please make sure that you follow the [style guide](#style-guide).
After you submit your pull request, a maintainer will take time to review your changes, request modifications and then merge your changes into the repository if they fit.

### Style guide

All contributions must follow the projectâ€™s [style guide](../.editorconfig).
Shell scripts must also comply to [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
Sticking to a common set of conventions makes it easier for everyone to read the source code and reduces the time spent reviewing little formatting details.

The code style for shell scripts will automatically be checked when you submit your pull request.
You may also check it manually by running `make format` (or `make format-fix` to automatically fix any issues) at the root of the repository (you need to have [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) installed on your computer for this to work).

Compliance of shell scripts to Shellcheck will also automatically be checked.
To check it manually, run `make lint` at the root of the repository (you need to have Shellcheck installed on your computer for this to work).
